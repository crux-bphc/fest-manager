            p Pearl is the annual national cultural fest of BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus. Incepted in 2009 as an intra-college festival, the fest grew into a national level college cultural fest with participation from more than 100 colleges across India. Pearl hosts a variety of cultural events and competitions which include music, dance, literary, photography and quizzing. This yearâ€™s Hyderabad theme is just one more reason to look forward to the annual cultural fest that we know and adore.
