## Documentation Index

Our documentation is very incomplete and we could use quite a bit of help in this department. We have the following pages in our documentation right now:

1. **[Nginx Configuration](nginx)** -  Setting up the nginx server to act as reverse proxy for our node server.
2. **[Typeahead Guide](typeahead)** - A feature guide on using the typeahead/autocomplete feature for custom fields.
